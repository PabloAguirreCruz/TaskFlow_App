## Description

TaskFlow is a productivity app built to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can create tasks with priority levels (high, medium, low), set due dates, organize tasks into color-coded categories, and track progress with status updates (to-do, in-progress, done).

**Why I built this:** I wanted to create a practical tool that solves a real problem - staying organized. This project also allowed me to demonstrate full CRUD functionality with user authentication in a MEN stack application.
