USER STORIES
------------



As a user, I want to be able to sign up and log in to my account so that I can have my own personal task list that only I can access.

As a user, I want to be able to create new tasks with important details like the title, description, priority level (low, medium, high), status (to-do, in-progress, done), and an optional due date.

As a user, I want to see all my tasks in one place. This page should show the task title, priority, status, and due date to keep it organized and easy to scan.

As a user, I want to be able to filter my tasks by status, priority, or category so I can quickly find what I'm looking for.

As a user, I need to be able to click on any task in my list and see all the details about it on a new page. This includes everything I've recorded about that task.

As a user, when I'm looking at all the details of a task, I want to be able to change any of the information. There should be an easy-to-find link that takes me to a different page where I can make these changes and then save them.

As a user, if I'm looking at the details of a task, I want a simple way to delete it completely, like clicking a 'Delete' button.

As a user, I want to quickly change a task's status from the main list without having to go into the edit page.

As a user, I want to create categories with custom names and colors so I can organize my tasks into groups (like "Work", "Personal", "Shopping").

As a user, I want to assign tasks to categories so I can keep related tasks together.

As a user, I want to view all tasks within a specific category on one page.

As a user, I want to edit and delete categories. When I delete a category, the tasks should remain but become uncategorized.
